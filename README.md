Mindless Tasks (https://cmsvtr.github.io/mindless-game/) is a game created as the final final project in month one of the Ironhack Fullstack Web Dev fulltime bootcamp.

With the orientation of the principal teacher, Karen, and the two teacher assistants, Jino and Danielle, I sought to develop a game that would exercise the HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge acquired during this first module.

The game is set in an office environment and the green and black aesthetics was purposeful in referencing outdated work-flows.

The main objetive of the game is to click on the correct clerk, depending on the "form" presented to the player. The clerk that should receive each form is redefined randomly at each round, and the player has a few seconds to memorize the designated clerk. The player must not make more than 10 mistakes, nor allow too many forms to pile up.

In between levels, there is an intermission screen and a mini-game appears where the player competes with a random selecting bot in tic-tac-toe.
